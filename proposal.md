# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Chess game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A python chess game that can be played by two human players. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For our project we are going to build a chess game. It is going to be a simple functional game that will be restricted to same rules as a traditional chess game regarding movement of pieces and checkmate rules. Our game will be a human vs human game that be run anytime.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

- Kidus Adamte - tup08857@temple.edu, Rahad Arman Nabid
- Natanim Abebe - tuo98558@temple.edu, Rahad Arman Nabid
- Nathan Adiam - nathan.adiam@temple.edu, Rahad Arman Nabid

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Implement a chess board with pieces placed in the right places
- Allow user interaction to make pieces move

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Implement correct/legal movement of pieces on board
- Implement pieces to legally capture and be captured 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Implement checkmate and announce winner 
- Make a visual representation of catured pieces on the side 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

### First week
- Research pygame 
- Setup working environment
- Build chess board 

### Second week 
- Add pieces to the board 
- Start coding legal moves for pieces

### Third week 
- Implement capturing of pieces 
- Implement checkmate
